# Quick Start

Deep Java Library (DJL) is designed to be the lowest barrier of entry for Deep Learning.
The easiest way to learn DJL is to read the [beginner tutorial](../jupyter/tutorial) or our [examples](../examples).

## Prerequisites

* You need to have JDK installed on your system. We recommend using JDK 8, but any later version will also work. For more information, see [Setup](development/setup.md).
* You need to have git installed on your system to clone the DJL repository.

## Get source code

We try our best to maintain a stable master branch. However, if you run into issues, please try to use the latest 
[stable release](https://github.com/awslabs/djl/releases/latest).

## Beginner Tutorial

The best way to get started is to follow our short [beginner tutorial](../jupyter/tutorial). It takes you through some of the basics of deep learning for creating a model, training your model, and running inference using your trained model.

## Run Examples

DJL also provides examples for both training and performing inference with deep learning models. The examples and their source code can be found in the [examples](../examples) directory.
 
All of our examples can be executed by a simple command. Please refer to each exampleâ€™s README for detailed command line instructions:

- [Train your first model](../examples/docs/train_mnist_mlp.md)
- [Single-shot Object Detection inference example](../examples/docs/object_detection.md)
- [More examples](../examples)
- [Jupyter examples](../jupyter)
