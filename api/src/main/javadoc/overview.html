<p>This document is the API specification for the Joule.</p>

<p>The key design goal for Joule API is to make it extremely easy to get started and simple to
use deep learning framework for Java developers. They need not be ML/DL experts to get started
and can start from their existing Java expertise as an on-ramp to learn and use ML/DL. They can
use their favorite IDE to build/train/deploy their models and integrate these models with their
Java applications. They don’t have to compromise on model performance, scale, choice of GPU vs.
CPUs.

<p>Joule API is deep learning framework agnostic, developer does not have to make a choice
between framework while they started their project. They can switch to different framework at any
time they want.

<p>Joule API provide native Java development experience, just another regular java library.
Joule's ergonomic API interface is designed to guide developer with best practice to accomplish
deep learning task.

<p>The following is an example of how to write inference code.

<pre>
    // Assume user has a pre-trained already, they just need load it
    Model model = <b>Model.loadModel</b>(modelDir, modelName);

    // User must implement <a href="software.amazon/ai/Translator.html" title="interface in software.amazon.ai"><code>Translator</code></a> interface, read <a href="software.amazon/ai/Translator.html" title="interface in software.amazon.ai"><code>Translator</code></a> for detail.
    Translator translator = new <b>MyTranslator</b>();

    // User can specify GPU/CPU <a href="software.amazon/ai/Context.html" title="class in software.amazon.ai"><code>Context</code></a> to run inference session.
    // This context is optional, <a href="software.amazon/ai/inference/Predictor.html" title="interface in software.amazon.ai.inference"><code>Predictor</code></a> can pick up default Context if not specified.
    // See <a href="software.amazon/ai/Context.html#defaultContext--"><code>Context.defaultContext()</code></a>
    Context context = Context.defaultContext();

    // Next user need create a <code>Predictor</code>, and use <a href="software.amazon/ai/inference/Predictor.html#predict-I-"><code>Predictor.predict()</code></a>
    // to get prediction.
    try (Predictor&lt;BufferedImage, List&lt;DetectedObject&gt;&gt; predictor =
            <b>Predictor.newInstance</b>(model, translator, context)) {
        List&lt;DetectedObject&gt; result = predictor.<b>predict</b>(img);
    }
</pre>

<p>The following is an example of how to write training code.

<p>Joule API contains following packages:
<ul>
    <li>software.amazon.ai – This packages contains top level common classes shared for both inference and training.
    <li>software.amazon.ai.engine – This packages contains classes responsible for loading deep learning framework.
    <li>software.amazon.ai.inference – This packages contains classes to implement inference tasks.
    <li>software.amazon.ai.metric – This packages contains classes to collect metrics information.
    <li>software.amazon.ai.modality.* – These packages contain utility classes for each predefined modalities.
    <li>software.amazon.ai.ndarray.* – These packages contain classes and interfaces that defines n-dimensional array.
    <li>software.amazon.ai.nn.* – These packages contain classes defines neural network operators.
    <li>software.amazon.ai.training.* – These packages contain classes to implement training tasks.
</ul>
