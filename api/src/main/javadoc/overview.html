<p>This document is the API specification for djl.ai.</p>

<p>The key design goal for the djl.ai API is to simplify the use of deep learning frameworks for Java
  developers. Developers don't need to be Machine Learning/Deep Learning experts to get started.
  They can start with their existing Java expertise as a foundation to learn and use ML/DL.
  Developers can
  use their favorite IDE to build, train, and deploy their models. They can also easily integrate
  these models with their
  Java applications. They don't have to compromise on model performance, scale, or choice of GPU vs.
  CPUs.

<p>djl.ai API is deep learning framework agnostic. Developers don't have to make a choice
  between frameworks when they start their project. They can switch to a different framework at any
  time.

<p>djl.ai API provides a native Java development experience and functions as any other regular Java
  library would.
  djl.ai's ergonomic API interface is designed to guide developers with best practices to accomplish
  deep learning tasks.

<p>The following is an example of how to write inference code:

<pre>
    // Assume user has a pre-trained already, they just need load it
    Model model = <b>Model.load</b>(modelDir, modelName);

    // User must implement <a href="ai/djl/translate/Translator.html"><b>Translator</b></a> interface, read <a
    href="ai/djl/translate/Translator.html"><b>Translator</b></a> for detail.
    Translator translator = new <b>MyTranslator</b>();

    // User can specify GPU/CPU <a href="ai/djl/Device.html"><b>Device</b></a> to run inference session.
    // This device is optional, <a
    href="ai/djl/inference/Predictor.html"><b>Predictor</b></a> can pick up default Device if not specified.
    // See <a
    href="ai/djl/Device.html#defaultDevice--"><b>Device.defaultDevice()</b></a>
    Device device = Device.defaultDevice();

    // Next user need create a <b>Predictor</b>, and use <a
    href="ai/djl/inference/Predictor.html#predict-I-"><b>Predictor.predict()</b></a>
    // to get prediction.
    try (Predictor&lt;BufferedImage, List&lt;DetectedObject&gt;&gt; predictor = <b>model.newPredictor</b>(translator, device)) {
        List&lt;DetectedObject&gt; result = predictor.<b>predict</b>(img);
    }
</pre>

<p>The following is an example of how to write training code.

<p>djl.ai API contains following packages:
<ul>
  <li>ai.djl - This package contains common top level classes shared by both inference
    and training.
  <li>ai.djl.engine - This package contains classes responsible for loading deep
    learning frameworks.
  <li>ai.djl.image - This package contains utility classes for image processing.
  <li>ai.djl.inference - This package contains classes to implement inference tasks.
  <li>ai.djl.metric - This package contains classes to collect metrics information.
  <li>ai.djl.modality.* - These packages contain utility classes for each predefined
    modalities.
  <li>ai.djl.ndarray.* _ These packages contain classes and interfaces that define
    n-dimensional arrays.
  <li>ai.djl.nn.* - These packages contain classes define neural network operators.
  <li>ai.djl.training.* - These packages contain classes to implement training tasks.
</ul>
