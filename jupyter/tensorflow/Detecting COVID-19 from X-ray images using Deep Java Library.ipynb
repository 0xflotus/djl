    "## Introduction\n",
    "As you may already know, there is a on-going global pandemic caused by the [Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html).  It’s an infectious disease caused by a new virus that quickly spread over the world. It has caused severe health, financial, and economic impact globally. Many countries have declared a state of emergency and we are facing many unprecedented challenges in dealing with this disease. Testing COVID-19 is one of main challenges as we need to identify people with COVID-19 and isolate them to slow down the spread of the disease. To know more about COVID-19, please follow the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and your local public health authorities.\n",
