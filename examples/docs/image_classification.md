# Image classification example

Image classification refers to the task of extracting information classes from an image.

In this example, we will show you how to implement inference code with Deep Java Library (DJL) to recognize handwritten digits from an image.

The image classification example code can be found at [ImageClassification.java](https://github.com/awslabs/djl/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/ai/djl/examples/inference/ImageClassification.java).

You can also find the jupyter notebook tutorial [here](../../jupyter/README.md#run-image-classification-with-your-first-model).
The jupyter notebook explains the key concepts in detail.

## Setup Guide

Follow [setup](../../docs/development/setup.md) to configure your development environment.

## Run the image classification example

### Prepare your model
The model we're using is generated by the [training example](train_your_first_model.md).
Run the training example to generate the model before continuing with this example.
The trained model will be stored as `build/model/mlp-XXXX.params`.

### Input image file
In the previous training example, we trained the model using the grayscale handwritten digit dataset, MNIST.
You can find the following image in your project test resource folder: `src/test/resources/0.png`

![0](../src/test/resources/0.png)

### Build the project and run

Run the project using the following command:
```
cd examples
./gradlew run -Dmain=ai.djl.examples.inference.ImageClassification
```
Your output should look like the following:
```text
[INFO ] - [
        class: "0", probability: 0.99996
        class: "2", probability: 0.00002
        class: "6", probability: 5.4e-06
        class: "9", probability: 2.5e-06
        class: "8", probability: 8.5e-07
]
```

The results show that there's a 99.996% probability that the image contains a "0" digit.
