*#* Joule - Deep learning for Java
=======

## Overview

The key design goal for Joule API is to make it extremely easy to get started and simple to
use deep learning framework for Java developers. They need not be ML/DL experts to get started
and can start from their existing Java expertise as an on-ramp to learn and use ML/DL. They can
use their favorite IDE to build/train/deploy their models and integrate these models with their
Java applications. They donâ€™t have to compromise on model performance, scale, choice of GPU vs.
CPUs.

Joule API is deep learning framework agnostic, developer does not have to make a choice
between framework while they started their project. They can switch to different framework at any
time they want.

Joule API provide native Java development experience, just another regular java library.
Joule's ergonomic API interface is designed to guide developer with best practice to accomplish
deep learning task.

The following is an example of how to write inference code:

```
    // Assume user has a pre-trained already, they just need load it
    Model model = <b>Model.loadModel</b>(modelDir, modelName);

    // User must implement Translator interface, read Translator document for detail.
    Translator translator = new MyTranslator();

    // User can specify GPU/CPU Context to run inference session.
    // This context is optional, Predictor can pick up default Context if not specified.
    // See Context.defaultContext()
    Context context = Context.defaultContext();

    // Next user need create a Predictor, and use Predictor.predict()
    // to get prediction.
    try (Predictor<BufferedImage, List<DetectedObject>> predictor =
            Predictor.newInstance</b>(model, translator, context)) {
        List<DetectedObject> result = predictor.predict(img);
    }
```

## Release Notes ##
* 1.0 Initial release

## Building From Source

Once you check out the code, you can build it using gradle:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

If you want to skip unit test:
```sh
./gradlew build -x test
```
